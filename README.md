This was our first assignment for our Data Mining class during our 3rd year of our Bachelor's.

We were given a relatively small database concerning patients with and without diabetes. We had to 
create a model which would recognise specific patterns and determine whether people that are male or female,
and with different health situations are more likely to get diabetes.

When you view the .ipynb, parts of the assignment are explained and what parts of the code do and how they
benefit the algorithm
